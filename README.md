# Spaudion

This is a fork of [Audion](https://dev.panic.com/panic/audion) that replaces the file player with a very basic Spotify controllers. It supports pause, play, skip forward/back, and volume control. Right now it's just a one-day hack, so it probably doesn't use the Spotify API very responsibly.

To run, create `Audion/SpotifyCredentials.swift` like this:

```swift
struct SpotifyCredentials {
  static let clientId = "xyzzy"
  static let clientSecret = "updownupdownleftrightleftrightbastart"
}
```

You'll probably also need to change the development team on FaceKit.

Don't forget to `git submodule init && git pull`.
